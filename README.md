____

Binary-Classification using Linear Classification
Using The part of Iris data (2 classes and two features, choosen by yourshelf => 100 data). http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris 

do the following steps:

1. Load the Iris data from scikit learn and divide the data into two parts: training and test data with ration 80:20. Make sure that the class within each parts of the data is balance. (score: 0.5)

2. Using scatter plot (matplotlib), visualise the Iris data (training part only) (score: 0.5)

3. Define a python function for sigmoid function (score:0.5)

4. Define a python function of the cost function (score:0.5)

5. Define a python function for the Gradient Descent algorithm (score: 0.5)

6. Train your NN-SLP algorithm on the training data, set learning rate: 0.001 and maximum iteration: 100 (score: 0.5)

7. Find thetha(s) that minimize the cost function, and plot the decision boundary using matplotlib.  (score: 1.0)

8. Test your Linear Classifier on the test data, and calculate the accuracy (score: 0.5)

9. Plot your cost function using matplotlib (cost function vs iteration) (score: 0.5)


Note: 
You should submit 
1) a python notebook in the format linearclassifier_fullname_yourclass.ipynb (ex: linearclassifier_afiahayati_KKPMDD.ipynb)
2) Create a report (*.pdf) . You have to explain the codes (no 1-9) and give the results (for no 6-9). =>  linearclassifier_afiahayati_KKPMDD.pdf 
This assignment will take 10% of the total marks.


Deadline 25th April, 23.00 (midnight), submission only via Elok.
Penalty 75% for copying code/report (for both parts : who are copying and whom his/her works being copied)
no late submission
